Presentation Delivery Feedback Tool
===================================

This project is a prototype Presentation Delivery Feedback Tool developed for 
COMP47700. It is designed to assist university students in practising and improving 
their spoken communication skills by providing automated feedback on presentation 
delivery.
## A+ Presentation Feedback Tool

</p>

The tool analyses a short audio recording of the user reading a presentation-style 
passage and provides objective feedback on key delivery metrics including:

- Speech rate (Words Per Minute)
- Vocal inflection (pitch variation)
- Vocal energy (volume/projection)
- Pause usage (timing and frequency)
- Filler words (e.g., "um", "eh")

By offering structured and actionable feedback, this tool aims to help students 
deliver clearer, more confident, and more engaging presentations.

Overview of Features
--------------------

- Audio feature extraction using:
  - `librosa` for pitch and energy analysis
  - `pydub` for pause detection
  - `speech_recognition` for transcription and WPM calculation
- Automatic detection of filler words
- Rule-based evaluation logic grounded in public speaking literature
- Visualisation of key metrics (e.g., pitch contour, pause distribution)
- Simple web-based interface built with Streamlit

Typical Workflow
----------------

1. User records or uploads an audio sample of a presentation.
2. The tool processes the audio, extracts relevant features, and generates a 
transcript.
3. Heuristics evaluate the delivery and produce targeted feedback.
4. Users receive visual and textual summaries, including suggestions for 
improvement.
5. Users may re-record the passage to assess progress.

Technical Summary
-----------------

- **Speech Rate**: Calculated by dividing transcript word count by duration.
- **Pitch**: Extracted using `librosa.pyin` and analysed for range and variation.
- **Energy**: Measured using RMS (Root Mean Square) loudness.
- **Pauses**: Detected using `pydub.silence` analysis.
- **Filler Words**: Identified via keyword scan of the transcript.

Educational Value
-----------------

This tool enables users to:

- Develop greater self-awareness regarding speech delivery
- Practise critical aspects of public speaking independently
- Receive consistent, evidence-based feedback
- Monitor improvement through repeated trials

Technologies Used
-----------------

- Python
- Streamlit
- librosa
- pydub
- speech_recognition
- matplotlib / seaborn

Evaluation Method
-----------------

The toolâ€™s impact is assessed through a before-and-after test:

- Users record a first attempt and receive feedback
- They then re-record the same passage after reviewing the suggestions
- Changes in metrics such as pitch variation, speech rate, and vocal energy are 
compared to assess improvement
